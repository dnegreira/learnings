# Debugging cloud-init

When one wants to debug why things have not happened properly with cloud-init, we can test the scripts using `cloud-init devel` command.
The scripts are located on `/var/lib/cloud/instance/`

# Add SSH key and user to LXD container

`lxc profile edit default`

Add the following:

```yaml
config:
  user.user-data: |
    #cloud-config
    packages:
      - ssh
    users:
      - name: dnegreira
        ssh_import_id:
          - lp:dnegreira
        sudo: ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL
        shell: /bin/bash
        groups: users, admin
```
