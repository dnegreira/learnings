Python cryptography module from version 3.4 onwards requires Rust to be compiled.
This causes issues with snap builds packages and its internal dependencies.

Quick fix on the `snapcraft.yaml` file:
```
python-packages:
      - cryptography==3.4
      - wheel
      - pip
      - setuptools
    requirements:
      - requirements.txt
    build-environment:
      - "CRYPTOGRAPHY_DONT_BUILD_RUST": "1"
```

snapcraft is able to build with lxd and has been generally faster than multipass for me

```
snapcraft --use-lxd
```
