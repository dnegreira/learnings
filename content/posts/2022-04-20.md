You can force to build a package in python by using --no-binary.
Sometimes the python wheel comes with dependencies that the image that you are using cannot be met, and using --no-binary proves to be useful when you want to build against a very specific set of binaries / libc versions.
[Reference here.](https://cryptography.io/en/latest/installation/#build-on-linux)

Example:

`pip install cryptography --no-binary cryptography`

**Attention**: Make sure to install all the necessary build dependencies before doing the above.
