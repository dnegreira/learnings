      <description>Python cryptography module from version 3.4 onwards requires Rust to be compiled. This causes issues with snap builds packages and its internal dependencies.
Quick fix on the snapcraft.yaml file:
python-packages: - cryptography==3.4 - wheel - pip - setuptools requirements: - requirements.txt build-environment: - &amp;#34;CRYPTOGRAPHY_DONT_BUILD_RUST&amp;#34;: &amp;#34;1&amp;#34; Reference: https://github.com/canonical/hotsos/blob/main/snap/snapcraft.yaml
 snapcraft is able to build with lxd and has been generally faster than multipass for me
snapcraft --use-lxd </description>

      <description>This is my first post on the daily learnings. My aim is to document my daily learnings and get back to them when necessary. Maybe it is also a way to forge knowledge deep in my subconscious, since I will need to write it once again.
Feel free to contact me via twitter if you have any comment/suggestion.</description>
